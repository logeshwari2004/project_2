# AR/VR-Based Interactive Spatial Learning in Education
## Aim:
The aim of this project is to develop an immersive VR-based educational system to enhance the learning experience for mechanical engineering students. This system enables learners to explore and interact with 3D car engine components in a virtual environment, fostering a deeper understanding of engine mechanics through hands-on engagement and quizzes.

## About:
This project leverages Virtual Reality (VR) and 3D modeling to create an interactive educational tool for students studying car engine mechanisms. Users can dismantle, explore, and reassemble engine components within a virtual garage, providing a realistic and engaging learning experience. The system includes detailed explanatory panels for each part and a quiz module to reinforce knowledge. By incorporating interactive features such as snap zones, object manipulation, and real-time feedback, the project aims to bridge the gap between theoretical learning and practical application.

## Features
● Immersive 3D Learning Environment – Users can navigate and interact with car engine components in a virtual garage.

● Interactive Exploration – Learners can dismantle, inspect, and reassemble engine parts for a hands-on experience.

● Educational Panels – Each engine component is accompanied by informative panels providing detailed explanations.

● Snap Zones and Object Manipulation – Ensures precise positioning and realistic interaction with engine parts.

● Knowledge Assessment via Quizzes – A built-in quiz module tests learner understanding after exploration.

● Performance Tracking & Feedback – Provides users with score analysis and satisfaction feedback for improved learning.

● Realistic Physics and User Interface – Enhances engagement through an intuitive VR-friendly interface.

## Requirements:
● Software & Development Tools: Unity (with XR Toolkit), Blender (for 3D modeling), C# (for scripting interactions).

● Hardware: Oculus VR Headset, Controllers, High-performance PC with VR-ready GPU.

● 3D Models: Custom-designed engine components (Cylinder Head, Piston, Crankshaft, etc.).

● User Interface & Interaction: VR snap zones, interaction logic, physics-based movement for realistic experience.

● Assessment Tools: Quiz system for evaluating learner understanding and engagement.

## Results and Impact:
The AR/VR-Based Interactive Spatial Learning in Education project demonstrates the effectiveness of immersive VR technology in enhancing the learning experience for mechanical engineering students. By enabling interactive exploration of car engine components, this system provides a realistic and engaging educational platform, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. The results indicate a high level of learner engagement and improved understanding of engine mechanics through hands-on interaction. Users reported that exploring and manipulating engine parts in VR helped them grasp complex mechanical concepts more effectively. The quiz-based assessment further reinforced learning, validating the system's ability to serve as an effective educational tool. With its immersive approach and interactive design, this project showcases the potential of VR technology in revolutionizing technical education.
